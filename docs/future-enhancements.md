- **Planned Features**:
- **Roadmap**:

- **Security Enhancements:**  The report doesn't explicitly mention security features. Implementing robust user authentication, authorization, and data encryption is crucial for protecting sensitive patient health information.
- **Granular User Roles and Permissions:**  Define user roles and permissions to control access to specific functionalities based on user profiles (e.g., healthcare worker, data analyst). This ensures data security and adherence to data governance principles.
- **Audit Trail Implementation:**  Implement audit trails to track user activity and data changes for accountability purposes and troubleshooting potential data integrity issues.
- **Integration with DataRun:**  The system is designed to accommodate workflow management functionalities. This might involve:
      ***Workflow Builder:**  A user interface where program administrators can define and configure workflows for different activities.
      ***Task Management:**  track assigned tasks, their status (pending, completed, overdue), and responsible personnel.
      ***Data Pre-population:**  pre-populate forms with relevant data based on the workflow context (e.g., beneficiary information during ITN distribution).
      ***Reporting:**  Generate reports to track workflow progress, identify bottlenecks, and measure overall efficiency.
